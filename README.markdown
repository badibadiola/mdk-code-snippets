## Disclaimer

This repository contains small code snippets in various programming languages. Those snippets cover a range of different subjects -- from trivial ones (like opening and reading a file) to more complex ones (OpenGL initialization, accessing flickr). 

The only reason for having those is to help my flaky memory and allow me to point people to locations instead of typing same stuff all over again.

You're encouraged to do whatever you want with the code here. All stuff is MIT X11 license *except* if otherwise noted in the header.
